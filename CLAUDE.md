# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This repository contains a presentation about CLI tools for developers, written in Markdown format with custom theming. The presentation focuses on terminal-based development tools and workflows.

## Project Structure

- `presentation.md` - Main presentation file with slides about various CLI tools
- `theme.json` - Custom theme configuration for the presentation renderer

## Common Commands

### Viewing the Presentation

This appears to be a terminal-based presentation that likely requires a Markdown presentation tool (such as `slides`, `mdp`, or similar). The presentation references a custom theme file and includes paging configuration.

## Architecture Notes

The presentation is structured as a Markdown file with:
- YAML frontmatter containing metadata (theme reference, author, date, paging, width)
- ASCII art title slide
- Multiple sections covering different categories of CLI tools
- Custom theming defined in `theme.json` with specific colors and formatting for different Markdown elements

The theme uses a dracula color scheme for code blocks and custom prefixes for different heading levels.
